# PDrAW - Parrot Drones Audio and Video Vector

_PDrAW_ (pronounced like the name "Pedro") is an audio and video pipeline
building library supporting Parrot _ANAFI_ drones. It supports MP4 recordings,
RTP/RTSP streaming with H.264 and H.265 video and AAC audio.

_PDrAW_ was formerly _Parrot Drones Awesome Video Viewer_ when it was only a
video player. It was originally written by AurÃ©lien Barre as a personal project
and is now officially maintained by Parrot Drones SAS.

_PDrAW_ is the main video pipeline implementation of _Ground SDK_ used in the
_FreeFlight_ applications, both on iOS and Android. It is also used on Parrot's
drones and remotes for video pipelines implementations.

_PDrAW_ is also available on desktop platforms (Linux and macOS) as part of the
Parrot Drones SDK.

#### Threading model

The library is designed to run on a _libpomp_ event loop (_pomp_loop_, see
_libpomp_ documentation), except for rendering functions. All API functions
must be called from the _pomp_loop_ thread and all callback functions are
called from the _pomp_loop_ thread, except for rendering function which must
be called on the rendering (OpenGL) thread and rendering callback functions
which are called also on the rendering thread. _The RecordMuxer_ element runs
on a dedicated internal thread to optimize MP4 writing efficiency.

### Helper libraries

#### libpdraw-backend

_libpdraw-backend_ is a wrapper for _libpdraw_'s API that allows calling
functions from any thread, with the exception of rendering functions which
must still be called from the rendering thread.

Available APIs for _libpdraw-backend_ are:

* C
* C++

The library depends on the following Alchemy modules:

* libfutils
* libpdraw
* libpomp
* libulog

#### libpdraw-vsink

_libpdraw-vsink_ is a helper library to easily create a _libpdraw_ instance
on a stream or record without rendering and get YUV frames, for example to
process them with OpenCV in an application.

The API is available in C. The functions can be called from any thread but
are not thread-safe: they should always be called from the same thread,
or it is the caller's responsibility to synchronize calls if multiple threads
are used.

The _libpdraw-vsink_ module provides two methods for retrieving frames:
* Synchronous retrieval using the _pdraw_vsink_get_frame()_ function.
  * In blocking mode (timeout_ms = -1 or timeout_ms > 0)
  * In non-blocking mode (polling, with timeout_ms = 0),
* Asynchronous retrieval by registering a _get_frame_cb_t_ callback.
  Note: This callback is executed from the _pdraw_vsink_ thread. The caller must
  ensure thread safety and be aware that the _pdraw_vsink_ thread is blocked
  during the callback execution.

The library depends on the following Alchemy modules:

* libfutils
* libmedia-buffers
* libmedia-buffers-memory
* libmedia-buffers-memory-generic
* libpdraw
* libpomp
* libulog

#### libpdraw-gles2hud

_libpdraw-gles2hud_ is a helper library to draw an OpenGL ES 2.0 example HUD
(Head-Up Display) on top of the rendered video using _libpdraw_'s rendering
overlay callback function.

The API is available in C. All functions must be called from the rendering
thread.

The library depends on the following Alchemy modules:

* eigen
* libpdraw
* libulog
* libvideo-metadata
* opengl

#### qpdraw

_qpdraw_ is a helper library to easily create a _Qt_ application using
_libpdraw-backend_. The following classes are provided:

* QPdraw (QObject), a _libpdraw-backend_ wrapper.
* QPdrawDemuxer (QObject), a demuxer wrapper
* QpdrawWidget (QOpenGLWidget), a renderer wrapper

The API is available in C++.

The library depends on the following Alchemy modules:

* libfutils
* libpdraw-backend
* libulog

### Applications

Applications are built on top of _libpdraw_, _libpdraw-backend_,
_libpdraw-vsink_ or *qpdraw*.

#### pdraw-desktop

_pdraw-desktop_ is Linux PC, macOS and Windows application written in C
using SDL2 for windowed display and the UI.

The application depends on the following Alchemy modules:

* eigen
* libfutils
* libmedia-buffers
* libpdraw
* libpdraw-backend
* libpdraw-gles2hud
* libpomp
* libulog
* libvideo-defs
* libvideo-metadata
* sdl2
